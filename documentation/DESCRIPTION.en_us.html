	Amarna is a semi-glyphic humanist sans-serif typeface, taking inspiration from the cold sophistication of early humanist sans- and glyphic serifs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans/">Gill Sans</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_(typeface)">Albertus</a>, while attempting to bring the traits which define those typefaces in line with the principles of modern sans-serif type design.
	Amarna is amicable and easy to read in small sizes, but takes on a more glyphic, naturalistic quality when rendered in larger sizes, at lighter weights and especially in all-caps text.
	Amarna is a fully variable font in both weight and italic axes, with weights currently ranging from 100 (Hairline) to 700 (Bold).
